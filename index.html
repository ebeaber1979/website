            <p>
                I am a husband and father of 2. 
                I started learning about computers when I was 8 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first computer experience was when my uncle brought home a
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>.
                This did include the tape deck and the amazing 5 and a quarter inch floppy.
                Text based games with less than 8 bit graphics on 12 disks. I must be old. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since that day I was hooked. Every class I could take in school or something I could learn from a friend was all I focused on.
                Then came the internet and what a time it has been. 
            </p>
